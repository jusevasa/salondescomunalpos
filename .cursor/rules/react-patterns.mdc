# React 19 + TypeScript Patterns

## Component Structure
- Use function components with TypeScript
- Props interfaces named `{ComponentName}Props`
- Export components as default, types as named exports

## Hooks Usage
- Prefer React Query for server state
- Use Zustand for complex client state
- Custom hooks in feature `/hooks` folders
- Global hooks in `src/hooks/`

## Form Handling
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Schemas in `src/lib/validations/`
- Form components in feature `/components`

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 classes
- shadcn/ui component variants
- Custom styles in `src/styles/`

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase.tsx
- Hooks: camelCase.ts (useFeatureName)
- Services: camelCase.ts
- Types: camelCase.ts or PascalCase.ts
